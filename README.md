## Building
### Windows
1. Install Vulkan SDK (1.2 or higher)
2. Call Win-GenProject.bat or run ```premake5 vs2019```
3. Extract libs.7z in Libraries\vulkan
4. Extract libs.7z in Libraries\assimp
5. Copy all dll's from Libraries\fmod\libs to output (bin\) folder
6. Under configuration properties makes sure that Yojimbo project is set to "build"
